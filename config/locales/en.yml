  steps_html: "
              <p>To participate:</p>
              <p>1. Write down one letter or number during an orgasm. </p>
              <p>2. Take a picture of the result </p>
              <p>3. Upload it on the site (with an optional anecdote).</p>"
  cloture_html: "
                The produced glyphs will be sorted into 5 fonts :
                from &laquo; quickie &raquo; for
                ultra-light to &laquo; &eacute;pectase &raquo; for black.<br>
                Since the characters were made during the <i>little death</i> of more than 3000 people,
                every word written in Erography embodies a universal orgy; <i>our graphic bacchanale.</i>"

            <p><span class="question">Why?</span><br>
            The typeface use will be revealed on the release date</p>
            <p><span class="question">What can I write on?</span><br>
            On every surface where the handwriting is readable : paper, wall, tablecloth  <i>etc …</i>
             As long as the character is legible, the surface or the medium is irrelevant</p>
            <p><span class="question">What to write in the “short story” field?</span><br>
            It’s an optional field to write something funny or weird about the origin of the letter or the orgasm’s
            circumstances for example.</p>
            <p><span class="question">Is it really anonymous?</span><br>
            We have no way of finding out who uploaded the image : no email taken , no name , no number.</p>
            <p><span class="question">Where to find the finished product?</span><br>
            The typeface and the fonts will be displayed on this website on the xx/xx/xx. along with short-movie / documentary. </p>
